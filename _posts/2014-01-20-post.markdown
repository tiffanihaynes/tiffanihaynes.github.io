Whole Foods opened its fifth Austin location at the Domain on Wednesday, January 15. With several dining sections, an outdoor bar, live music area and a community room, the new market is as much a social venue as a grocery store. The company focus on organic and local shows up in the d√©cor as well as on the shelves. Guests are greeted at the front door by a brightly colored wheelbarrow art installation by Roadhouse Relics, and a ride up the escalator includes a view of a moss and steel wall feature crafted by Austin Articulture Designs.
